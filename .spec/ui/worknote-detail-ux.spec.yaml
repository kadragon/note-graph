title: "Work Note Detail UX Polish"
description: >
  Improve work note detail and todo reading/editing experience:
  quick-edit entry points when key fields are missing, duplicate save
  controls near the top, denser content spacing, and clearer todo
  typography with preserved line breaks.

given_when_then:
  - given: "User views a work note whose categories are empty"
    when: "The user clicks the '업무 구분 없음' chip"
    then: "The dialog switches to edit mode and focuses the category picker"

  - given: "User views a work note without assignees"
    when: "The user clicks the '담당자 없음' chip"
    then: "The dialog switches to edit mode and focuses the assignee selector"

  - given: "User is editing a work note with long content"
    when: "The user scrolls to the top"
    then: "A save action is available near the top without scrolling to the bottom"

  - given: "User reads work note content"
    when: "The content contains multiple paragraphs and lists"
    then: "Line spacing and paragraph gaps are compact enough to reduce scrolling while remaining legible"

  - given: "Todo list items with multi-line descriptions"
    when: "User views the todo list in the work note dialog"
    then: "Todo titles appear visually more prominent than descriptions, and descriptions honor line breaks"

  - "Focus behavior should not throw when refs are null (guarded check)"
  - "Spacing changes should be scoped to prose blocks to avoid global regressions"
