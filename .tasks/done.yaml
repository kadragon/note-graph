    title: "Implement authentication middleware"
    spec_id: SPEC-auth-1
    completed_at: "2025-11-18T03:00:00Z"
    outcome: |
      Successfully implemented Cloudflare Access authentication with:
      - Auth types and interfaces (AuthUser, AuthenticationError)
      - Auth middleware extracting Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email header
      - Development fallback using X-Test-User-Email header for testing
      - GET /me endpoint returning authenticated user information
      - Error handler returning 401 for authentication failures
      - All acceptance criteria met:
        ✓ Auth middleware extracts user email from headers
        ✓ /me endpoint returns user info (email, name)
        ✓ Unauthorized requests return 401 with proper error message
    test_results: |
      ✓ TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode
      ✓ Dev server runs successfully
      ✓ Test 1: /me without auth returns 401 (PASS)
      ✓ Test 2: /me with X-Test-User-Email header returns 200 with user info (PASS)
      ✓ Test 3: /me with Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email header returns 200 (PASS)
      ✓ Email normalization working (lowercase, trimmed)
