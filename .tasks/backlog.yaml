    notes: |
      Migrate 7 HTTP integration tests:
      - admin-embedding-failures.test.ts
      - project-files.test.ts
      - project-routes.test.ts
      - statistics-routes.test.ts
      - work-note-file-view.test.ts
      - work-note-project-association.test.ts
      Replace 'SELF.fetch()' with miniflare.dispatchFetch().
      May require worker build step for full stack testing.
      Estimated: 8-10 hours. Risk: High.

    notes: |
      Delete vitest.config.ts and tests/setup.ts (Vitest version).
      Uninstall vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers.
      Update package.json scripts to use Jest only.
      Update CI/CD pipelines (if any).
      Update documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING).
      Update .governance/memory.md with migration summary.
      Final validation: all 614+ tests pass in Jest.
      Estimated: 2-3 hours. Risk: Low.
