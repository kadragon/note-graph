  title: "Dashboard remaining todos grouped by work note & wait-until fix"
  status: in_progress
  started_at: "2025-11-28"

notes: |
  User request: Dashboard "남은 할 일" view should be grouped by work note, and wait-until calculation seems wrong.
  Actions: add grouping UI for remaining tab; audit wait_until filtering logic and fix inconsistency.
  Scope ties to SPEC-todo-1 (dashboard views and wait logic).
  Progress: Added grouping helper + UI wiring for remaining view; wait_until filtering now applied to remaining/week/month/backlog; new unit tests added.
