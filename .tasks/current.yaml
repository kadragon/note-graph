  TASK-006 completed successfully.

  Implemented:
  - Department type definitions (Department, DepartmentMember, DepartmentWorkNote)
  - DepartmentRepository with all CRUD operations
  - POST /departments - creates new department
  - GET /departments - lists all departments
  - GET /departments/:deptName - gets department by name
  - PUT /departments/:deptName - updates department
  - GET /departments/:deptName/work-notes - lists department's work notes

  All endpoints implement proper error handling with domain errors.
  Department members derived from person_dept_history where is_active=true.
  Department work notes found via work_note_person join.

  Ready to start TASK-007: Implement WorkNote repository with versioning.
