  TASK-011 completed successfully.

  Implemented hybrid search with RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) ranking:
  - Created HybridSearchService combining FTS and Vectorize results
  - Parallel execution of lexical (FTS) and semantic (Vectorize) searches
  - RRF algorithm merges results with k=60 constant (based on research)
  - Source attribution: LEXICAL, SEMANTIC, or HYBRID
  - Updated POST /search/work-notes to use hybrid search

  RRF Algorithm:
  - Formula: score = sum(1 / (k + rank)) for each result set
  - k=60 is the standard parameter from IR research
  - Results appear in both FTS and Vectorize get highest combined scores
  - Final results sorted by combined RRF score

  Key features:
  - HybridSearchService.search() - executes both searches in parallel
  - Automatic result merging with RRF ranking
  - Source attribution shows which engine(s) found each result
  - Graceful degradation: if one search fails, other continues
  - Fetch limit optimization: 2x limit for each engine, merge to final limit

  Integration:
  - POST /search/work-notes returns hybrid results with source attribution
  - searchType field now returns 'HYBRID' instead of 'LEXICAL'
  - Filters apply to both FTS and Vectorize searches
  - Category filter applied to Vectorize metadata

  Phase 3 (Search & AI) - TASK-009, TASK-010, and TASK-011 complete!
  Ready for TASK-012: RAG chunking and pipeline.
