  status: in_progress

notes: |
  Resuming paused test coverage task for SPEC-project-1. Added integration coverage for
  project detail associations, file metrics in stats, and project deletion archiving files
  to R2 archive prefix. Implemented archiveProjectFiles in ProjectFileService and wired
  DELETE /projects/:id to use it. Relevant tests passing:
  - npm test -- tests/integration/project-routes.test.ts
  - npm test -- tests/integration/project-files.test.ts tests/unit/project-file-service.test.ts
  Coverage run with `npm run test:coverage` failed due to Workers pool inability to load
  node:inspector (known @vitest/coverage-v8 issue). Need alternative strategy (Node env
  subset, nyc on unit tests, or CI-side bundling) to measure coverage.
