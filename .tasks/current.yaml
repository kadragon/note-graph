  TASK-005 completed successfully.

  Implemented:
  - Person type definitions (Person, PersonDeptHistory, PersonWorkNote)
  - PersonRepository with all CRUD operations
  - POST /persons - creates person with auto department history entry
  - GET /persons - lists persons with optional search
  - GET /persons/:personId - gets person by ID
  - PUT /persons/:personId - updates person and manages department history
  - GET /persons/:personId/history - retrieves full department history
  - GET /persons/:personId/work-notes - lists person's associated work notes

  All endpoints implement proper error handling with domain errors.
  Department history tracking works correctly (deactivates old, creates new on dept change).

  Ready to start TASK-006: Implement Department repository and CRUD endpoints.
