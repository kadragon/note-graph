  Session 37: Reconciled task tracker with actual implementation.
  TASK-039 (R2 file upload), TASK-040 (R2 file download), and TASK-041 (PROJECT scope RAG)
  were implemented but not recorded. All three tasks moved to done.yaml.

  Starting TASK-042: File text extraction and embedding pipeline.
  This will create async file processing queue for PDF/DOCX/TXT files with text extraction,
  chunking, and embedding with projectId metadata.
