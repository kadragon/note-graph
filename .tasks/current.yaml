  TASK-008 completed successfully.

  Implemented:
  - Todo type definitions (Todo, TodoWithWorkNote, TodoStatus, RepeatRule, RecurrenceType)
  - TodoRepository with recurrence strategies (DUE_DATE, COMPLETION_DATE)
  - POST /work-notes/:workId/todos - creates todo for work note
  - GET /work-notes/:workId/todos - lists todos for work note
  - GET /todos - lists todos with view filters (today, this_week, this_month, backlog, all)
  - PATCH /todos/:todoId - updates todo with automatic recurrence generation

  All endpoints implement proper error handling with domain errors.
  Recurrence logic generates new instance when status changes to '완료'.
  View filters correctly implement wait_until logic and date range filtering.
  Backlog view shows overdue todos (due < now AND status != '완료').

  Phase 2 (Entity Management) complete!
  Ready to start Phase 3: Search & AI Features.
