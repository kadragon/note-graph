  TASK-007 completed successfully.

  Implemented:
  - WorkNote type definitions (WorkNote, WorkNoteVersion, WorkNotePersonAssociation, WorkNoteRelation, WorkNoteDetail)
  - WorkNoteRepository with automatic versioning (max 5 versions)
  - POST /work-notes - creates work note with person associations and first version
  - GET /work-notes - lists work notes with comprehensive filters (category, person, dept, date range, keyword)
  - GET /work-notes/:workId - gets work note with all associations (persons, related notes)
  - PUT /work-notes/:workId - updates work note, creates new version, prunes old versions
  - DELETE /work-notes/:workId - deletes work note with cascade

  All endpoints implement proper error handling with domain errors.
  Versioning logic automatically prunes oldest versions when exceeding 5.
  Person and related work note associations managed with batch transactions.

  Ready to start TASK-008: Implement Todo repository with recurrence logic.
