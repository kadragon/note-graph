  title: "Replace checkbox-based assignee selector with searchable autocomplete"
  description: |
    Replace checkbox-based assignee selector with searchable autocomplete component
    using Command UI. This improves UX when there are many persons in the system.

notes: |
  TASK-021 completed. Department search UX improved with loading/error feedback,
  keyboard navigation, and 5-item suggestion cap.

  TASK-022 completed (main branch): Department creation fix with payload alignment.

  TASK-023 completed: Implemented embedding retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
  Automatic retry for failed embedding operations ensures eventual consistency between
  D1 and Vectorize. All 421 tests passing (100%).

  TASK-024 started: Replace checkbox-based assignee selector with searchable
  autocomplete component using Command UI.
